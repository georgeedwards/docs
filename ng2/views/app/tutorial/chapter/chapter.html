<p>Welcome to the <a href="http://www.nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a> Getting Started Guide. In this tutorial you&#39;ll use NativeScript, a cross-platform JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps, to build an iOS and Android app from scratch. You can start by watching the video walkthrough below, or by <a href="#what-is-nativescript">jumping straight into the hands-on tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-nativescript-">What is NativeScript?</h2>
<p>NativeScript is a free and open source framework for building native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and CSS. NativeScript renders UIs with the native platform’s rendering engine—no <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/">WebViews</a>—resulting in native-like performance and UX.</p>
<p>NativeScript provides a best-of-both-worlds development experience. Our cross-platform JavaScript modules give you the convenience of writing iOS and Android apps from a single JavaScript codebase, while our runtimes give you the power of accessing native APIs, SDKs, and frameworks when you need them—all without needing to open Xcode or Android Studio. NativeScript was created and is supported by <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-re-building">What you&#39;re building</h2>
<p>This guide will walk you through building <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries">Groceries</a>, a groceries management app that does the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connects to an existing RESTful service.</li>
<li>Provides user registration and login.</li>
<li>Lets authenticated users add and delete groceries from a list.</li>
<li>Runs cross-platform (iOS and Android).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow along to the end, here&#39;s what the finished app will look like on iOS:</p>
<p><img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter0/ios/1.png" alt="login">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter0/ios/2.png" alt="register">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter0/ios/3.png" alt="list"></p>
<p>And here&#39;s what the app will look like on Android:</p>
<p><img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter0/android/1.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter0/android/2.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter0/android/3.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and your development machine’s terminal. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: You should know basic JavaScript concepts, such as how functions, if statements, and loops work.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong>: You should know how to write simple CSS selectors, and know how to apply CSS rules as name/value pairs.</li>
<li><strong>The terminal</strong>: You should know how to open a terminal or command-line prompt on your development machine, how to change directories, and how to execute commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>
</div><div *ngIf="chapter == 1"><h1 id="chapter-1-getting-up-and-running">Chapter 1—Getting Up and Running</h1>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;re going to start with the basics, including installing the NativeScript CLI, starting a new project, and getting your first app up and running.</p>

## 1.1: Install NativeScript and configure your environment

The NativeScript CLI has a few system requirements you must have in place before building NativeScript apps. Before we get started building, make sure you’ve completed the NativeScript installation instructions using the link below.

* <a href="/angular/start/quick-setup">Complete the NativeScript installation guide</a>

## 1.2: Start your app

With the NativeScript CLI installed, it&#39;s time to start building your app. Normally, you would <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript-cli#create-project">use the <code>tns create</code> command to create an empty NativeScript application</a>. For this guide, we&#39;ve scaffolded out a boilerplate project to act as a starting point for <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries">Groceries</a>.
</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Get the Groceries starting point</h4>

Navigate to a folder where you want to keep your app code:

<div class="no-copy-button"></div>

<pre><code class="lang-bash">cd the-folder-you-want-groceries-to-be-in
</code></pre>
<p>Next, assuming you have <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">git installed</a>, clone the Groceries repo from GitHub:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-git">git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries.git
</code></pre>
<p>After that, change to the newly cloned repo&#39;s folder:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">cd sample-Groceries
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, switch to the “start” branch for this guide&#39;s starting point:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-git">git checkout start
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> The “end” branch has the final state of this guide&#39;s tutorial. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/tree/end">refer to the branch on GitHub</a> if you get stuck.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2 id="1-3-add-target-development-platforms">1.3: Add target development platforms</h2>
<p>Your app is now set up, but before you run it, you need to initialize a platform-specific native project for each platform you intend to target.</p>
<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add the iOS and Android platforms</h4>

If you&#39;re on a Mac, start by adding the iOS platform:

<code>bash
tns platform add ios</code>

Next, add the Android platform with the same <code>platform add</code> command:

<code>bash
tns platform add android</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

&gt;<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You can add platforms only for SDKs that you already have installed on your development machine. If you get errors running <code>tns platform add</code>, refer back to the section on <a href="#11-install-nativescript-and-configure-your-environment">setting up your development environment</a>.

The <code>platform add</code> command adds a folder called <code>platforms</code> to your project, and copies all of the required native SDKs into this folder. When you build the application, the NativeScript CLI will copy your application code into the <code>platforms</code> folder so that a native binary can be created.
</div>
## 1.4: Running your app

With the platform initialization complete, you can run your app in an emulator or on devices.

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><strong>Exercise</strong>: Run your app</h4>


If you&#39;re on a Mac, start by running the app in an iOS simulator with the following command:

<code>bash
tns run ios --emulator</code>

If all went well, you should see something like this:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter1/ios/1.png" alt="iOS login">

Next, run your app on an Android emulator with the following command:

<code>bash
tns run android --emulator</code>

&gt; <strong>WARNING</strong>:
&gt; <em> You must have at least one Android AVD (Android Virtual Device) configured for this command to work. If you get an error, try <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/using-android-emulator-hybrid-mobile-apps-telerik-appbuilder/#managing-avds">setting up an AVD</a> and then run the command again.
&gt; </em> If you&#39;re using <a href="https://www.genymotion.com">Genymotion</a>, launch your Genymotion virtual device, and then run <code>tns run android</code>.

If all went well, you should see your app running in an Android emulator:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter1/android/1.png" alt="Android login">

</div>

<div class="explain">

Here are a few other tips for running NativeScript apps.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>:
&gt; <em> To run on a USB-connected Android or iOS device, use the same <code>run</code> command without the <code>--emulator</code> flag—i.e. <code>tns run android</code> and <code>tns run ios</code>.
&gt; </em> The <code>tns device</code> command lists all USB-connected iOS devices, USB-connected Android devices, and Genymotion virtual devices that <code>tns run</code> can deploy to. Note that <code>tns device</code> does not list iOS simulators.


## 1.5: Development workflow

At this point, you have the NativeScript CLI downloaded and installed, as well as the iOS and Android dependencies that you need to run your app. Now you need a good workflow that lets you make changes and see results fast. For that we’ll use the <code>tns livesync</code> command.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Your first NativeScript change</h4>

If your previous <code>tns run ios</code> or <code>tns run android</code> task is still running, type <code>Ctrl+C</code> in your terminal to kill it.

If you’re on a Mac, start an iOS livesync watcher by executing the following command:

<code>bash
tns livesync ios --emulator --watch</code>

If you have your app running on an Android emulator, start an Android livesync watcher by executing the following command:

<code>bash
tns livesync android --emulator --watch</code>

If you instead have your app running on a USB-connected Android device or Genymotion virtual device, run the same command without the <code>--emulator</code> flag:

<code>bash
tns livesync android --watch</code>

The <code>tns livesync</code> command updates your app by transferring the updated source code to the device or simulator. By adding the <code>--watch</code> flag, the <code>livesync</code> command additionally watches the files in your NativeScript project. Whenever one of those files changes, the command detects the update, and patches your app with the updated code.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: You can learn about how this is possible by reading more about <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/nativescript-works/">how NativeScript works</a>.

To see livesync in action let’s make a small update to your app. Open your app&#39;s <code>app/views/login/login.xml</code> file in your text editor of choice and change <code>&lt;Label text=&quot;hello world&quot; /&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;Label text=&quot;hello NativeScript&quot; /&gt;</code>.

Save <code>app/views/login/login.xml</code> and you should see the app relaunch and the updated text displayed.

</div>

<div class="explain">

Regardless of whether you’re running on iOS or Android, or whether you’re using <code>tns livesync</code> or <code>tns run</code>, the NativeScript CLI shows the output of <code>console.log()</code> statements as your app executes, as well as stack traces when things go wrong. So if your app crashes at any time during this guide, look to the terminal for a detailed report of the problem.

The iOS and Android logs can be a bit noisy, so you might have to scroll up a bit to find the actual problem. For example if I try to call <code>foo.bar()</code> when <code>foo</code> does not exist, here&#39;s the information I get on iOS:

<code>/app/path/to/file.js:14:8: JS ERROR ReferenceError: Can&#39;t find variable: foo
1   0xe3dc0 NativeScript::FFICallback&lt;NativeScript::ObjCMethodCallback&gt;::ffiClosureCallback(ffi_cif*, void*, void**, void*)</code>

And here&#39;s the same information in the Android logs:

<code>E/TNS.Native( 2063): ReferenceError: foo is not defined
E/TNS.Native( 2063): File: &quot;/data/data/org.nativescript.groceries/files/app/./views/login/login.js, line: 13, column: 4</code>

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: When you&#39;re trying to debug a problem, you can also try adding <code>console.log()</code> statements in your JavaScript code—exactly as you would in a browser-based application.

&gt; <strong>WARNING</strong>: Not all changes can be livesync’d in a NativeScript app. For instance, livesync cannot patch native configuration file changes (<code>Info.plist</code>, <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>, and so forth), new plugin installations, and any other change that requires a full compilation of the application. In those cases, you’ll want to use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to stop livesync, and rerun the application using the <code>tns run ios</code> or <code>tns run android</code> commands. Don’t worry though; when situations that require a full compilation come up in this guide, these instructions will be explicitly listed.

Now that you&#39;ve created an app, configured your environment, and set up your app to run on iOS and Android, you&#39;re ready to start digging into the files that make up a NativeScript app.

</div></div><div *ngIf="chapter == 2"><h1 id="chapter-2-building-the-ui">Chapter 2—Building the UI</h1>
<p>Before you start coding the Groceries app it&#39;s important to understand a NativeScript app&#39;s folder structure. It&#39;ll help you understand where to place new files, as well as a bit of what&#39;s going on with NativeScript under the hood.</p>
<p>Go ahead and open your app&#39;s <code>sample-Groceries</code> folder in your text editor of choice and let&#39;s dig in.</p>
<div class="explain">

## Table of contents

- <a href="#21-directory-structure">2.1: Directory structure</a>
- <a href="#22-adding-ui-components">2.2: Adding UI components</a>
- <a href="#23-layouts">2.3: Layouts</a>
- <a href="#24-css">2.4: CSS</a>
- <a href="#25-images">2.5: Images</a>

## 2.1: Directory structure

To keep things simple, let&#39;s start by looking at the outer structure of the Groceries app:

<code>.
└── sample-Groceries
    ├── app
    │   └── ...
    ├── node_modules
    │   └── tns-core-modules
    ├── package.json
    └── platforms
        ├── android
        └── ios</code>

Here&#39;s what these various files and folders do:

- <strong>app</strong>: This folder contains all the development resources you need to build your app. You&#39;ll be spending most of your time editing the files in here.
- <strong>node_modules</strong>: This folder contains your app&#39;s npm module dependencies. All new NativeScript projects start with a single dependency on tns-core-modules.
- <strong>node_modules/tns-core-modules</strong>: This folder contains your app&#39;s NativeScript modules, which are a series of NativeScript-provided JavaScript modules you&#39;ll use to build your app. Each module contains the platform-specific code needed to implement some feature—the camera, http calls, the file system, and so forth—exposed through a platform-agnostic API (e.g. <code>camera.takePicture()</code>). We&#39;ll look at some examples momentarily.
- <strong>package.json</strong>: This file contains your app&#39;s configuration details, such as your app id, the version of NativeScript you&#39;re using, and also which npm modules your app uses. We&#39;ll take a closer look at how to use this file when we talk about using npm modules in <a href="chapter5">chapter 5</a>.
- <strong>platforms</strong>: This folder contains the platform-specific code NativeScript needs to build native iOS and Android apps. For example in the <code>android</code> folder you&#39;ll find things like your project&#39;s <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> and .apk executable files. Similarly, the <code>ios</code> folder contains the Groceries&#39; Xcode project and .ipa executables. Note, users on Windows machines will not have an <code>ios</code> folder.

The NativeScript CLI manages the <code>platforms</code> folder for you as you develop and run your app; therefore, it&#39;s a best practice to treat the <code>platforms</code> folder as generated code. The Groceries app includes the <code>platforms</code> folder in its <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/blob/master/.gitignore"><code>.gitignore</code></a> to exclude its files from source control.

Next, let&#39;s dig into the <code>app</code> folder, as that&#39;s where you&#39;ll be spending the majority of your time.

<code>.
└── sample-Groceries
    ├── app
    │   ├── App_Resources
    │   │   ├── Android
    │   │   └── iOS
    │   ├── shared
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── views
    │   │   └── login
    │   │       ├── login.js
    │   │       └── login.xml
    │   ├── app.css
    │   ├── app.js
    │   └── ...
    └── ...</code>
Here&#39;s what these various files and folders do:

- <strong>App_Resources</strong>: This folder contains platform-specific resources such as icons, splash screens, and configuration files. The NativeScript CLI takes care of injecting these resources into the appropriate places in the <code>platforms</code> folder when you execute <code>tns run</code>.
- <strong>shared</strong>: This folder, specific to the Groceries app, contains any files you need to share across views in your app. In the Groceries app, you&#39;ll find a few view model objects and a <code>config.js</code> file used to share configuration variables like API keys.
- <strong>views</strong>: This folder contains the code to build your app&#39;s views, each of which will have a subfolder in <code>views</code>. Each view is made up of an xml file, a JavaScript file, and an optional CSS file. The groceries app contains three folders for its three views.
- <strong>app.css</strong>: This file contains global styles for your app. We&#39;ll dig into app styling in <a href="#24-css">chapter 2.4</a>.
- <strong>app.js</strong>: This file sets up your application&#39;s starting module and initializes the app.

Let&#39;s start with <code>app/app.js</code>, as it&#39;s the starting point for NativeScript apps. Your <code>app.js</code> contains the two lines below: 

<code>javascript
var applicationModule = require(&quot;application&quot;);
applicationModule.start( &#123; moduleName: &quot;views/login/login&quot;  &#125;);</code>

Here, you&#39;re requiring, or importing, the <a href="">NativeScript application module</a>. Then, you call its <code>start()</code> method with the starting screen of your app (the login screen), which lives in your app&#39;s <code>views/login</code> folder.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: JavaScript modules in NativeScript follow the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS">CommonJS specification</a>. This means you can use the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1#Module_Context"><code>require()</code> method</a> to import modules, as is done above, as well as use the <code>export</code> keyword to expose a module&#39;s properties and methods, which we&#39;ll look at later in this chapter. These are the same constructs Node.js uses for JavaScript modules, so if you know how to use Node.js modules, you already know how to use NativeScript modules.

Now that your app is ready for development, let&#39;s add some UI components to make your login screen show more than some basic text.

## 2.2: Adding UI components

Let&#39;s dig into the files used to create your app&#39;s UI, which reside in the <code>app/views</code> folder. Each folder in <code>app/views</code> contains the code for one of the three pages in Groceries: <code>list</code>, <code>login</code>, and <code>register</code>. If you look in the <code>app/views/login</code> folder, you&#39;ll see three files: <code>login.css</code>, <code>login.js</code>, and the <code>login.xml</code> file we updated in the previous chapter. When you open <code>login.xml</code> again you should see the following code:

<code>xml
&lt;Page&gt;
    &lt;Label text=&quot;hello NativeScript&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/Page&gt;</code>

This page currently contains two UI components: a <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;Label&gt;</code>. To make this page look more like a login page, let&#39;s add a few additional components, namely two <code>&lt;TextField&gt;</code> elements and two <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code> elements.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add UI components to <code>login.xml</code></h4>

Open <code>app/views/login/login.xml</code> and replace the existing <code>&lt;Label&gt;</code> with the following code:

<code>xml
&lt;TextField hint=&quot;Email Address&quot; keyboardType=&quot;email&quot; autocorrect=&quot;false&quot; autocapitalizationType=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;
&lt;TextField hint=&quot;Password&quot; secure=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

&lt;Button text=&quot;Sign in&quot; /&gt;
&lt;Button text=&quot;Sign up for Groceries&quot; /&gt;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

NativeScript UI components provide attributes to let you configure their behavior and appearance. The code you just added uses the following attributes:

- <code>&lt;TextField&gt;</code>
    - <code>hint</code>: Shows placeholder text that tells the user what to type.
    - <code>keyboardType</code>: The type of keyboard to present to the user for input. <code>keyboardType=&quot;email&quot;</code> shows a keyboard optimized for entering email addresses. NativeScript currently supports <a href="/ui/keyboard.html">five types of keyboards</a> for text fields.
    - <code>autocorrect</code>: A boolean attribute that determines whether the mobile operating system should autocorrect user input. In the case of email address text fields, the autocorrect behavior is undesirable.
    - <code>autocapitalizationType</code>: Determines how the operating system should autocapitalize user input. <code>autocapitalizationType=&quot;none&quot;</code> turns autocapitalization off altogether. NativeScript supports <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/modules/_ui_enums_.autocapitalizationtype.html">four autocapitalization types</a> on text fields.
    - <code>secure</code>: A boolean attribute that determines whether the TextField&#39;s text should be masked, which is commonly done on password fields.
- <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code>
    - <code>text</code>: Controls the text displayed within the button.

After you <a href="#development-workflow">run your app</a> with this change, you will see a single <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code> component on the screen:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/ios/1.png" alt="login 1">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/android/1.png" alt="login 1">

Currently you only see a single button because you need to tell NativeScript how to layout your page’s UI components. Let&#39;s look at how to use NativeScript layouts to arrange these components on the screen.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: The NativeScript docs include a <a href="/ui-with-xml">full list of the UI components and attributes</a> with which you can build your apps. You can even <a href="/ui-with-xml#custom-components">build your own, custom UI components</a>.

## 2.3: Layouts 

NativeScript provides several different layout containers that allow you to place UI components precisely where you want them to appear. 

- The <a href="">Absolute Layout</a> lets you position elements using explicit x and y coordinates. This is useful when you need to place elements in exact locations, for example showing an activity indicator widget in the top-left corner of your app.
- The <a href="">Dock Layout</a> is useful for placing UI elements at the outer edges of your app. For example, a container docked at the bottom of the screen would be a good location for an ad.
- The <a href="">Grid Layout</a> lets you divide your interface into a series of rows and columns, much like a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> in HTML markup.
- The <a href="">Stack Layout</a> lets you stack child UI components either vertically or horizontally.
- The <a href="">Wrap Layout</a> lets child UI components flow from one row or column to the next when space is filled.

For your login screen, all you need is a simple <code>&lt;StackLayout&gt;</code> to stack the UI components on top of each other. In later sections, you&#39;ll use some of the more advanced layouts.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add a stack layout to the login screen</h4>

In <code>login.xml</code>, add a <code>&lt;StackLayout&gt;</code> component within the <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> component. <code>login.xml</code> should look like this:

<code>xml
&lt;Page&gt;
    &lt;StackLayout orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;

        &lt;TextField hint=&quot;Email Address&quot; keyboardType=&quot;email&quot; autocorrect=&quot;false&quot; autocapitalizationType=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;TextField hint=&quot;Password&quot; secure=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;Button text=&quot;Sign in&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;Button text=&quot;Sign up for Groceries&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
&lt;/Page&gt;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

The stack layout is a UI component, and as such, it has attributes just like the <code>&lt;TextField&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code> components you used in the previous section. Here, the <code>orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;</code> attribute tells the stack layout to arrange its child components vertically.

After you run your app with this change, you&#39;ll see that your login page&#39;s UI components stack up:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/ios/2.png" alt="login 2">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/android/2.png" alt="login 2">

Although the UI components are in the correct order, they could use some spacing and color to make the app look a bit nicer. To do that let&#39;s look at another NativeScript feature: CSS.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>:
&gt; <em> Refer to the NativeScript docs for a <a href="/layouts">more detailed look at how NativeScript layouts work</a> and the various things you can do to configure them.
&gt; </em> Check out Jen Looper&#39;s article on <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/blog/demystifying-nativescript-layouts">demystifying NativeScript layouts</a> for a thorough look at NativeScript layouts in action.

## 2.4: CSS

NativeScript uses a <a href="/styling">subset of CSS</a> to change the visual appearance of your app. You can use three mechanisms to add CSS properties to UI components: <a href="/styling#application-wide-css">application-wide CSS</a> (<code>app.css</code>), <a href="/styling#page-specific-css">page-specific CSS</a>, and an <a href="/styling#inline-css">inline <code>style</code> attribute</a>.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>:
&gt; <em> Place CSS rules that should apply to all pages in your <code>app.css</code>, and CSS rules that apply to a single page in a page-specific CSS file (e.g. <code>login.css</code>). 
&gt; </em> Although inline styles are great for quick testing—e.g. <code>&lt;Page style=&quot;background-color: green;&quot;&gt;</code> you should avoid them in general because the <code>style</code> attributes tend to clutter up xml files, especially if you need to apply multiple rules.

Let&#39;s start by adding a few application-wide CSS rules.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Create global styles</h4>

Paste the following code in the <code>app.css</code> file:

<code>css

Page  &#123;
    background-color: white;
    font-size: 17;
 &#125;
TextField  &#123;
    margin: 10;
    padding: 10;
 &#125;
Image  &#123;
    margin-top: 20;
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-right: 0;
    margin-bottom: 80;
 &#125;
Button  &#123;
    margin: 10;
    padding: 10;
 &#125;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

If you&#39;ve done any web development before, the syntax should feel familiar here. You select four UI components (Page, TextField, Image, and Button) by their tag name, and then apply a handful of CSS rules as name/value pairs. NativeScript does not support all CSS properties because it is not possible to replicate some of them in native apps without causing performance issues. A <a href="/styling#supported-properties">full list of the CSS properties that are supported</a> are listed in the NativeScript docs.

Let&#39;s make one more change. Although often you want CSS rules to apply equally to your iOS and Android app, occasionally it makes sense to apply a CSS rule to only one platform. For example, iOS text fields frequently have borders around them, but Android text fields do not. Let&#39;s look at how to make platform-specific style changes in NativeScript.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add platform-specific CSS</h4>

Add the following as the first line of your app&#39;s <code>app.css</code> file:

<code>css
 &#123; &#123;&#39;@import  &#123; url(&#39;~/platform.css&#39;)  &#125;;&#39; &#125; &#125;</code>

&gt; <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: NativeScript is consistent with browser implementations, in that <code>@import</code> statements must precede all other CSS rules in a file.

Next, add a <code>class=&quot;link&quot;</code> attribute to the sign up button in <code>login.xml</code>. The button&#39;s markup should look like this:

<code>xml
&lt;Button text=&quot;Sign up for Groceries&quot; class=&quot;link&quot; /&gt;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

Let&#39;s break down what just happened. First, NativeScript supports CSS&#39;s <code>@import</code> statement for importing one CSS file into another. So this new line of code imports the CSS rules from <code>platform.css</code> into <code>app.css</code>. But, you might have noticed that Groceries does not have a file named <code>platform.css</code>—only <code>app/platform.android.css</code> and <code>app/platform.ios.css</code> exist. What&#39;s going on here?

<a id="platform-specific-files"></a>When you execute <code>tns run</code>, or <code>tns livesync</code>, the NativeScript CLI takes your code from the <code>app</code> folder and places it in the native projects located in the <code>platforms/ios</code> and <code>platforms/android</code> folders. Here the naming convention comes in: while moving files, the CLI intelligently selects <code>.android.*</code> and <code>.ios.*</code> files. To give a specific example, the CLI moves <code>platform.ios.css</code> into <code>platforms/ios</code> and renames it to <code>platform.css</code>; similarly, the CLI moves <code>platform.android.css</code> into <code>platforms/android</code>, and again renames it to <code>platform.css</code>. This convention provides a convenient way to branch your code to handle iOS and Android separately, and it&#39;s supported for any type of file in NativeScript—not just CSS files. You&#39;ll see a few more examples of this convention later in this guide.

There&#39;s one other change here we need to discuss, and that&#39;s the <code>class</code> attribute you added to this button:

<code>xml
&lt;Button text=&quot;Sign up for Groceries&quot; class=&quot;link&quot; /&gt;</code>

NativeScript uses the <code>class</code> attribute for adding CSS class names to UI components. The class name is used to give the sign up button a slightly different look than the sign in button. You can find the CSS rules associated with this class name in <code>platform.ios.css</code> and <code>platform.android.css</code>:

<code>css

/* From platform.android.css */
.link  &#123;
    background-color: transparent;
 &#125;

/* From platform.ios.css */
.link  &#123;
    border-width: 0;
 &#125;</code>

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: NativeScript also supports selecting elements by the <code>id</code> attribute. Refer to the docs for <a href="/styling#supported-selectors">a full list of the supported selectors</a>.

With these changes in place, you&#39;ll notice that the app looks halfway decent now, and also has a distinctly different look on iOS and Android:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/ios/3.png" alt="login 1">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/android/3.png" alt="login 1">

Feel free to take some time to play with the look of this app before moving on. You can try adding some additional CSS class names, or adding some page-specific styles in your <code>login.css</code> file. When you&#39;re ready, let&#39;s move on and add an image to this login screen.

## 2.5: Images

In NativeScript you use the <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> UI component and its <code>src</code> attribute to add images to your pages. The <code>src</code> attribute lets you specify your image in three ways. The first (and simplest) way is to point at the URL of an image:

<code>xml
&lt;Image src=&quot;https://www.nativescript.org/images/default-source/landingpages/logo.png&quot; /&gt;</code>

The second way is to point at an image that lives within your app&#39;s <code>app</code> folder. For example if you have an image at <code>app/images/logo.png</code>, you can use it with:

<code>xml
&lt;Image src=&quot;~/images/logo.png&quot; /&gt;</code>

The third way, and the one Groceries uses, is to use platform-specific image resources. Let&#39;s add an image to the login screen and then discuss exactly what&#39;s happening.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add a logo</h4>

In <code>login.xml</code>, add the <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> below as the first child of the existing <code>&lt;StackLayout&gt;</code> tag:

<code>xml
&lt;Image src=&quot;res://logo&quot; stretch=&quot;none&quot; horizontalAlignment=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;</code>
</div>

<div class="explain">

The <code>res://</code> syntax tells NativeScript to use a platform-specific resource, in this case an image. Platform-specific resources go in your app&#39;s <code>app/App_Resources</code> folder. If you look there you&#39;ll find a few different image files, several of which are named <code>logo.png</code>.

Although more complex than putting an image directly in the <code>app</code> folder, using platform-specific images gives you more control over image display on different device dimensions. For example iOS lets you provide three different image files for devices with different pixel densities. As such you&#39;ll find logos named <code>logo.png</code>, <code>logo@2x.png</code>, and <code>logo@3x.png</code> in your <code>App_Resources/iOS</code> folder. For Android you&#39;ll find similar image files in <code>App_Resources/Android/drawable-hdpi</code> (for &quot;high&quot; dpi, or high dots-per-inch), <code>App_Resources/Android/drawable-mdpi</code> (for medium-dpi), and <code>App_Resources/Android/drawable-ldpi</code> (for low-dpi).

Once these files are in place the NativeScript framework knows how to pick the correct file; all you have to do is reference the image using <code>res://</code> and its base file name—i.e. <code>res://logo</code>. Here&#39;s what your login screen should look like on iOS and Android:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/ios/4.png" alt="login 4">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter2/android/4.png" alt="login 4">

At this point your UI looks good, but the app still doesn&#39;t actually do anything. Let&#39;s look at how you can use JavaScript to add some functionality.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: The community-written <a href="http://nsimage.brosteins.com/">NativeScript Image Builder</a> can help you generate images in the appropriate resolutions for iOS and Android.

</div></div><div *ngIf="chapter == 3"><h1 id="chapter-3-application-logic">Chapter 3—Application Logic</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you&#39;ll learn how to add JavaScript logic to your NativeScript app, and you&#39;ll be doing so using the base pattern on which the NativeScript framework is built, MVVM, or &quot;model view view model&quot;. </p>
<div class="explain">

Here&#39;s what those words mean:

- <strong>Model</strong>: The model defines and represents the data. Separating the model from the various views that might use it allows for code reuse.
- <strong>View</strong>: The view represents the UI, which in NativeScript is written in XML. The view is often data-bound to the view model so that changes made to the view model in JavaScript instantly trigger visual changes to UI components.
- <strong>View Model</strong>: The view model contains the application logic (often including the model), and exposes the data to the view. NativeScript provides a module called &#39;Observable&#39;, which facilitates creating a view model object that can be bound to the view.

The biggest benefit of separating models, views, and view models, is that you are able to use two-way data binding; that is, changes to data in the model get instantly reflected on the view, and vice versa. The other big benefit is code reuse, as you&#39;re often able to reuse models and view models across views.

In Groceries, so far you&#39;ve only touched the view (<code>login.xml</code>), and in this chapter you&#39;ll be creating a view model. To do so, we first need to introduce one other type of file: the code-behind.

## Table of contents

- <a href="#31-the-code-behind">3.1: The code-behind</a>
- <a href="#32-navigating-screens">3.2: Navigating screens</a>
- <a href="#33-accessing-ui-components">3.3: Accessing UI components</a>
- <a href="#34-adding-a-view-model">3.4: Adding a view model</a>

## 3.1: The code-behind

In NativeScript a code-behind file is a JavaScript file that shares the same name as the view. For example, the login page&#39;s view is named <code>login.xml</code>, so its code-behind file is named <code>login.js</code>. The code-behind file is where you put all code that interacts with the view itself.

Let&#39;s look at what you can do in a code-behind file with a simple example.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Construct the login view model</h4>

Open <code>login.xml</code> and add a <code>loaded</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> UI component at the top. It should look like this:

<code>xml
&lt;Page loaded=&quot;loaded&quot;&gt;</code>

Next, paste the code below in <code>app/views/login/login.js</code> to define a <code>loaded()</code> function:

<code>javascript
exports.loaded = function()  &#123;
    console.log(&quot;hello&quot;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The keyword <code>exports</code> is part of <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1">CommonJS</a>, the standard on which both NativeScript and Node.js&#39; implementations of modules are based. In CommonJS-based JavaScript modules, a free variable called <code>exports</code> is an object to which a module might add properties and methods to configure its external API. Using <code>exports</code> in a code-behind file exposes the function for use in the view, or XML file. That is, the <code>exports.loaded</code> assignment in the code-behind file is what makes <code>loaded=&quot;loaded&quot;</code> in the view work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you run the app with this change, NativeScript triggers the <code>loaded()</code> function you created in the code-behind file, and you should see the word “hello” logged in your terminal.</p>
<p><img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/terminal-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This simple example shows you how you can append attributes to UI components to run functions in the view&#39;s accompanying JavaScript file. Let&#39;s use another one of these attributes: <code>tap</code>.</p>
<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Enable the buttons</h4>

You can add a <code>tap</code> attribute that will fire when the user taps or touches a button. In <code>app/views/login/login.xml</code>, switch the two buttons at the bottom of the screen to use this markup:

<code>xml
&lt;Button text=&quot;Sign in&quot; tap=&quot;signIn&quot; /&gt;
&lt;Button text=&quot;Sign up for Groceries&quot; class=&quot;link&quot; tap=&quot;register&quot; /&gt;</code>

Then, at the bottom of the <code>app/views/login/login.js</code> file, paste in the following <code>signIn()</code> and <code>register()</code> functions:

<code>javascript
exports.signIn = function()  &#123;
    alert(&quot;Signing in&quot;);
 &#125;;

exports.register = function()  &#123;
    alert(&quot;Registering&quot;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<p>At this point, if you run your app and tap either of the buttons, you will see the appropriate alerts pop up. </p>
<p><img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/ios/1.png" alt="login 5">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/android/1.png" alt="login 5"></p>
<p>Now that you can see tap gestures working, let&#39;s make them do something more interesting than open alerts.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-navigating-screens">3.2: Navigating screens</h2>
<p>When you tap the “Sign up for Groceries” button, you would expect a navigational change to a registration screen. This is very easy to do in NativeScript.</p>
<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Enable the “Sign up” button on the login screen with a navigational change</h4>

In <code>app/views/login/login.js</code>, add this line to the top of the file:

<code>javascript
var frameModule = require(&quot;ui/frame&quot;);</code>

Then, replace the current <code>register()</code> function with the version shown below:

<code>javascript
exports.register = function()  &#123;
    var topmost = frameModule.topmost();
    topmost.navigate(&quot;views/register/register&quot;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

This function uses the <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/modules/_ui_frame_.html">frame module</a>, which is the NativeScript module responsible for navigation in your app. Here, you tell the topmost frame, or the frame the user actually sees, to navigate to the register view. 

If you run your app and click the “Sign up for Groceries” button, you will be sent to the registration screen, which we have pre-built for you.

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/ios/2.gif" alt="navigate">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/android/2.gif" alt="navigate">

Now that you can access the registration page, go ahead and sign up for an account to use for the rest of this tutorial.

</div> 

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Register for an account</h4>

Open Groceries and tap “Sign up for Groceries” to access the registration page. From there, provide an email address and password, and click the “Sign up” button to create an account.

You can use a fake email address and password, just remember your credentials as you&#39;ll need them later.

</div>

<div class="explain">

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: Although our Groceries app doesn&#39;t use complex navigation strategies, you have several available to you out of the box, such as the <a href="/ui-views#tabview">TabView</a> and the <a href="/ui-views#segmentedbar">SegmentedBar</a>. A SideDrawer component is also available for free via Telerik&#39;s <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/introduction">UI for NativeScript</a> product.

## 3.3: Accessing UI components

It&#39;s time to see how data flows back and forth between the front end and back end in forms.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Send data from the front end to the view model</h4>

Open <code>login.xml</code> and add an <code>id=&quot;email&quot;</code> attribute to the email text field. Its markup should look like this:

<code>xml
&lt;TextField id=&quot;email&quot; hint=&quot;Email Address&quot; keyboardType=&quot;email&quot; autocorrect=&quot;false&quot; autocapitalizationType=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;</code>

With an <code>id</code> attribute in place, you can access this text field in your code-behind file. To do that, start by opening <code>app/views/login/login.js</code> and adding the two lines of code below at the top of the file, underneath the <code>frameModule</code> variable.

<code>javascript
var page;
var email;</code>

Next, edit the <code>loaded()</code> function in <code>login.js</code> to get a reference to the current page:

<code>javascript
exports.loaded = function(args)  &#123;
    page = args.object;
 &#125;;</code>

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: This works because NativeScript passes <code>loaded</code> event handlers a reference to the <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> in the function&#39;s argument, which is named <code>args</code> by convention.

Finally, edit the <code>signIn()</code> function to get a reference to the text field component and log its contents:

<code>javascript
exports.signIn = function()  &#123;
    email = page.getViewById(&quot;email&quot;);
    console.log(email.text);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

All NativeScript UI components, including <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code>, inherit from the <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_core_view_.view.html"><code>View</code> class</a>, which gives them a number of methods for working the UI. In this case you use the <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_ui_core_view_.view.html#getviewbyid"><code>getViewById()</code> method</a> to get a reference to the email text field by its <code>id</code> attribute.

To see how this works in action, run the app, type some text in the email address text field, and tap the “Sign in” button. If all went well, you should see the text you typed logged in your terminal.

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/terminal-2.png" alt="">

By accessing UI elements in JavaScript, you can control how those elements look and behave on the front end. However, accessing these UI components individually is a very manual process, and it makes it hard to track the state of the UI. This is where view models come in.

## 3.4: Adding a view model

NativeScript provides view model functionality in the form of a module called &#39;Observable&#39;.

The Observable is the view model in the MVVM design pattern. It provides a mechanism used for two-way data binding, to enable direct communication between the UI and code-behind file. This means that if the user updates the data in the UI, the change will be automatically reflected in the view model, and vice versa. 

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Create a view model and bind it to the view</h4>

To allow for two-way data binding using an Observable, open <code>login.xml</code>, and replace the two existing TextField UI components with the two shown below, each including a new <code>text</code> attribute:

<code>xml
&lt;TextField id=&quot;email&quot; text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; email  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot; hint=&quot;Email Address&quot; keyboardType=&quot;email&quot; autocorrect=&quot;false&quot; autocapitalizationType=&quot;none&quot; /&gt;
&lt;TextField secure=&quot;true&quot; text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; password  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot; hint=&quot;Password&quot; /&gt;</code>

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: The use of two curly brackets surrounding the <code>text</code> attribute&#39;s value delineates a data-bound value. You will be setting corresponding properties with the same name in the view model.

Add the following code to the top of <code>app/views/login/login.js</code>. The code gets a reference to the <code>Observable</code> constructor from the observable module, and invokes the constructor to define a new <code>user</code> object, which you&#39;ll be using as this page&#39;s view model:

<code>javascript
var Observable = require(&quot;data/observable&quot;).Observable;

var user = new Observable( &#123;
    email: &quot;user@domain.com&quot;,
    password: &quot;password&quot;
 &#125;);</code>

Now, replace the existing <code>loaded()</code> function with the one below, which sets <code>user</code> as the binding context for the page.

<code>javascript
exports.loaded = function(args)  &#123;
    page = args.object;
    page.bindingContext = user;
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<p>What&#39;s going on here?</p>
<ol>
<li>You&#39;re creating a <code>user</code> view model that is based on the NativeScript Observable module. You create the view model with two properties, <code>email</code> and <code>password</code>, that are pre-populated with some dummy values.</li>
<li>You bind the page to the <code>user</code> view model by setting it as the page&#39;s <code>bindingContext</code> property. This is specifically what makes the curly bracket syntax work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply put, properties placed on a page&#39;s binding context are available to XML elements using the <code> &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; propertyName  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;</code> syntax. Because JavaScript sets the view model&#39;s <code>email</code> to <code>&quot;user@domain.com&quot;</code>, and because you bound the email address text field to that property using <code>&lt;TextField text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; email  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot;&gt;</code>, when you run this app you&#39;ll see &quot;user@domain.com&quot; appear on the front end.</p>
<p><img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/ios/3.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter3/android/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What&#39;s really cool is that the binding is two-way. Meaning, when the user types text in these text fields, those changes are immediately applied to your view model.</p>
<p>To use these values, and to make this login functional by tying your app into a backend service, you&#39;re going to need the ability to make HTTP calls. And to make HTTP calls in NativeScript you use the NativeScript fetch module. Let&#39;s look at how NativeScript modules work.</p>
</div><div *ngIf="chapter == 4"><h1 id="chapter-4-nativescript-modules">Chapter 4—NativeScript Modules</h1>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;ll learn about NativeScript modules, which are the JavaScript modules in your app&#39;s <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules</code> folder. Whether you&#39;ve realized it or not, you&#39;ve already used several NativeScript modules. This includes the modules you&#39;ve brought in via <code>require()</code> (the view, frame and observable modules) and also the UI components you&#39;ve been using in XML (the page, image, text field and button modules).</p>
<div class="explain">

If you dig into <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules</code> you can get an idea of how these modules work. Start by finding the <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules/camera</code> folder, which includes the implementation of the camera module. It includes:

- a <code>package.json</code> file that sets the name of the module;
- a file containing the module&#39;s Android implementation (<code>camera.android.js</code>);
- a file containing the module&#39;s iOS implementation (<code>camera.ios.js</code>);
- a file containing code shared by the Android and iOS implementations (<code>camera-common.js</code>)

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: You can refer to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules">Node.js documentation on folders as modules</a> for more detailed information on how NativeScript organizes its modules.

The *.ios.* and *.android.* naming convention should look familiar, as it&#39;s the exact same convention we used to include Android- and iOS-specific styling in <a href="#24-css">chapter 2.4</a>. NativeScript uses this same convention to implement its modules on iOS and Android. Now that you know where these modules are, let&#39;s take a closer look at what else they can do for your app.

## 4.1: Connecting to a backend

When you created your own account on the registration page, you probably noticed that data was magically going... somewhere. But there&#39;s actually no magic involved; the register page invokes a RESTful API provided by <a href="http://www.telerik.com/backend-services">Telerik Backend Services</a> to register the user for the Groceries service.

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: You don&#39;t have to use Telerik Backend Services to hit your backend service; you can use any HTTP API in a NativeScript app. Telerik Backend Services is convenient for us to use for this tutorial because it lets us spin up HTTP endpoints quickly.

Take a look at <code>app/shared/config.js</code>. There&#39;s only a small code snippet there, but it includes a hardcoded root path to the Groceries backend that the register page uses, and that you&#39;ll be using momentarily:

<code>javascript
module.exports =  &#123;
    apiUrl: &quot;https://api.everlive.com/v1/GWfRtXi1Lwt4jcqK/&quot;
 &#125;;</code>

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: <code>config.js</code> also shows a convenient pattern you can use for sharing configuration variables throughout your app.

Next, take a look in the <code>app/shared/view-models</code> folder, which contains a few view models that we&#39;ve pre-packaged into Groceries, and those view models contain the code to hit our backend. You can see this demonstrated in the <code>user-view-model.js</code> file&#39;s <code>register()</code> function.

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: In a larger app, it&#39;s pretty common to place code that interacts with the backend in separate files, and not directly in the view models. But in our case, the connection code lives directly in the view model for simplicity—which is perfectly reasonable for small apps. 

Note that the <code>register()</code> function uses the config module to get the path to the backend, as well as the <a href="">fetch module</a> to make HTTP calls.

<code>javascript
var config = require(&quot;../../shared/config&quot;);
var fetchModule = require(&quot;fetch&quot;);</code>

NativeScript&#39;s fetch module uses the same API as the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">browser&#39;s new fetch() API</a>. Therefore, if you already know how to use the web&#39;s <code>fetch()</code> method, you already know how to make HTTP calls in NativeScript. Let&#39;s look at how the fetch module works by adding another method to the user view model.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Complete the login in the view model</h4>

Open <code>app/shared/view-models/user-view-model.js</code> and paste the following code directly above the existing <code>viewModel.register()</code> function:

<code>javascript
viewModel.login = function()  &#123;
    return fetchModule.fetch(config.apiUrl + &quot;oauth/token&quot;,  &#123;
        method: &quot;POST&quot;,
        body: JSON.stringify( &#123;
            username: viewModel.get(&quot;email&quot;),
            password: viewModel.get(&quot;password&quot;),
            grant_type: &quot;password&quot;
         &#125;),
        headers:  &#123;
            &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;
         &#125;
     &#125;)
    .then(handleErrors)
    .then(function(response)  &#123;
        return response.json();
     &#125;)
    .then(function(data)  &#123;
        config.token = data.Result.access_token;
     &#125;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

Let&#39;s break down what the code you just pasted in does.

- You use the fetch module&#39;s <code>fetch()</code> method to POST data to the <code>apiUrl</code> stored in <code>shared/config.js</code>. The username, password and grant_type are sent to this endpoint as a JSON string. (Telerik Backend Services <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/platform/backend-services/development/rest-api/users/authenticate-user">requires a grant_type parameter</a> for logins.)

- The <code>fetch()</code> method returns a <code>Promise</code>, which allows you to execute code after the asynchronous login either completes successfully or fails. You use this functionality to do three things (the three <code>then()</code> handlers).
    - First, you handle any errors in the HTTP response with a <code>handleErrors()</code> function defined at the bottom of <code>user-view-model.js</code>. (If you want more details on how handling HTTP response errors with <code>fetch()</code> works check out <a href="http://tjvantoll.com/2015/09/13/fetch-and-errors/">this article</a>.)
    - Next, you convert the returned data into JSON by calling the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response"><code>Response</code></a> object&#39;s <code>json()</code> method.
    - Finally, you save a reference to the user&#39;s authentication token in the config module. You&#39;ll use that token on subsequent HTTP requests later in this guide.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>:
&gt; <em> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promises</a> are a part of ECMAScript 6 (the scripting language of which JavaScript is an implementation). Because Promises have been implemented in the two JavaScript engines NativeScript uses—V8 for Android and JavaScriptCore for iOS—Promises are available for use in NativeScript apps.
&gt; </em> NativeScript makes <code>fetch()</code> available as a global variable for convenience. This means you can replace <code>fetchModule.fetch()</code> with <code>fetch()</code>. The global <code>fetch()</code> shortcut will be used for the remainder of this guide.

With this code in place let&#39;s return to <code>login.js</code> to use this new function.

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="explain">

Take a moment to look at just how clean your code-behind file is now. The code-behind instantiates a view model (<code>UserViewModel</code>), and calls its <code>signIn()</code> method when the user taps the view&#39;s sign in button. Because the view model is bound to the page&#39;s two text fields (remember <code> &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; email  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;</code> and <code> &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; password  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;</code>), the view model already has the data it needs to perform the actual login.

And if you try running your app, and input your account&#39;s credentials, you can indeed login, but... you don&#39;t see anything. That&#39;s because view models aren&#39;t responsible for updating the UI. Instead the view model returns a <code>Promise</code> to let the code-behind handle the UI. (Remember that <code>fetch()</code> returns a <code>Promise</code>.) Let&#39;s see how you can use that <code>Promise</code>, and introduce a new NativeScript module in the process.

## 4.2: Dialog module

To utilize the <code>Promise</code> that the view model&#39;s <code>login()</code> function returns, you need to handle two scenarios: what to do when the login works, and what to do when it doesn&#39;t.

In the case of Groceries, when the login works you&#39;re going to navigate the user to the list page, which you&#39;ll be building momentarily, and which will let the user add and remove groceries from a list. To do the navigation you&#39;ll use the same frame module you used earlier in this guide.

The trickier situation is handling login failures, and for that you&#39;re going to use the dialog module. You can use this module to show <a href="">several types</a> of popup UIs in your app, including action sheets, confirmation boxes, alert boxes, and prompts. It is a highly customizable module, and it lets you control the buttons in your alerts, their text, and the messaging in the alert itself. The dialog module&#39;s code is in the <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules/ui</code> folder with other UI widgets. Let&#39;s see how to use this widget on the login page.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Handle an error with a dialog window</h4>

Add the following line to the top of <code>login.js</code> to import the dialog module:

<code>javascript
var dialogsModule = require(&quot;ui/dialogs&quot;);</code>

Next, re-write your <code>signIn()</code> function to look like this:

<code>javascript
exports.signIn = function()  &#123;
    user.login()
        .catch(function(error)  &#123;
            console.log(error);
            dialogsModule.alert( &#123;
                message: &quot;Unfortunately we could not find your account.&quot;,
                okButtonText: &quot;OK&quot;
             &#125;);
            return Promise.reject();
         &#125;)
        .then(function()  &#123;
            frameModule.topmost().navigate(&quot;views/list/list&quot;);
         &#125;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

This code handles both a successful and unsuccessful login. On success, you call the frame module&#39;s <code>navigate()</code> method to navigate the user to the (currently empty) list page. On failure, you use the dialog module to show the user an error message. Try inputting some invalid credentials to see what the dialog looks like.

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/ios/1.png" alt="login 8">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/android/1.png" alt="login 8">

With that, the login page is completely functional. Now that you have user management working in your NativeScript app, let&#39;s move onto the page where users will manage their grocery list. To do that, you need a module that shows items in a list, which is exactly what the ListView module does.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: From this point forward in the guide you&#39;ll have to log in a lot, so you may find it helpful to hardcode your credentials in the app during development. The easiest way to do that is to pass an email address and password to the <code>UserViewModel()</code> constructor, for example:

&gt; <code>javascript
&gt; var user = new UserViewModel( &#123;
&gt;     email: &quot;username@domain.com&quot;,
&gt;     password: &quot;password&quot;
&gt;  &#125;);
&gt;</code>

## 4.3: ListView

The ListView widget lets you show a list of things on the screen, which is exactly what you need for showing a list of groceries. Before tying the grocery list to a backend API, let&#39;s start by seeing how to show a hardcoded list of items on the screen.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Construct the list view</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.xml</code> and paste in the code below, which creates the list where your groceries will reside:

<code>xml
&lt;Page loaded=&quot;loaded&quot;&gt;
    &lt;GridLayout&gt;
        &lt;ListView items=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; groceryList  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;ListView.itemTemplate&gt;
                &lt;Label text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; name  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot; horizontalAlignment=&quot;left&quot; verticalAlignment=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/ListView.itemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/ListView&gt;
    &lt;/GridLayout&gt;
&lt;/Page&gt;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: Notice that this page is going to use a <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> to layout the UI components on the screen. As you add more UI components, you&#39;ll start dividing the screen into rows and columns, but for now you&#39;re just going to let the <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code> take up the full screen (which is the default behavior of a <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> with no attributes).

As discussed earlier, even though you&#39;re using <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code> in XML, the ListView module is still a NativeScript module. You can find its implementation in the <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules/ui/list-view</code> folder. If you want to, you could construct a ListView in pure JavaScript code in the code-behind file as shown in <a href="">this example</a>. For most situations using the NativeScript UI modules in XML is easier, so we&#39;ll be sticking with XML usage throughout this tutorial.

Note the use of <code>&lt;ListView.itemTemplate&gt;</code>. This tag gives you the ability to control how each of the ListView&#39;s items displays within the list. For now you&#39;re using a simple <code>&lt;Label&gt;</code> UI component to display the <code> &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; name  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;</code> of each grocery.

If you run this code as is, you won&#39;t see any items in the grocery list. First you need to build out a way to manage data within the ListView module, and to do that you&#39;re going to need a new NativeScript module: the ObservableArray.

## 4.4: Working with arrays

In the previous section of this guide you saw how to create observables and how to use them to connect XML views with code-behind files and view models. You&#39;re going to do the same thing in this section with one additional twist, and it involves making this <code>items</code> attribute work:

<code>xml
&lt;ListView items=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; groceryList  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot;&gt;</code>

The ListView module&#39;s <code>items</code> attribute takes an array, and to create that array on the view model, NativeScript provides a special ObservableArray module. To see how it works, let&#39;s start building the list page&#39;s code-behind file.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Populate the list view</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.js</code> and paste in the following code:

<code>javascript
var dialogsModule = require(&quot;ui/dialogs&quot;);
var Observable = require(&quot;data/observable&quot;).Observable;
var ObservableArray = require(&quot;data/observable-array&quot;).ObservableArray;
var page;

var pageData = new Observable( &#123;
    groceryList: new ObservableArray([
         &#123; name: &quot;eggs&quot;  &#125;,
         &#123; name: &quot;bread&quot;  &#125;,
         &#123; name: &quot;cereal&quot;  &#125;
    ])
 &#125;);

exports.loaded = function(args)  &#123;
    page = args.object;
    page.bindingContext = pageData;
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

Here, you&#39;re creating a new Observable object called <code>pageData</code>, which you set as the page&#39;s <code>bindingContext</code> in the <code>load()</code> function. Inside the Observable, you set a single <code>&quot;groceryList&quot;</code> property to be a new instance of the ObservableArray class. Notice how the <code>&quot;groceryList&quot;</code> property corresponds to <code>&lt;ListView items=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; groceryList  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot;&gt;</code>, and each array entry&#39;s <code>&quot;name&quot;</code> property corresponds to <code>&lt;Label text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; name  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot;&gt;</code>. If you run your app you&#39;ll see the list screen shows the hardcoded data:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/ios/2.png" alt="list 1">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/android/2.png" alt="list 1">

Now that we have items on the screen let&#39;s look at how you can tie this list to a backend instead of hardcoded data. To do so you&#39;ll switch the list page to use a view model, much like you did with the login page.

A starting view model for this page is already in the file at <code>app/shared/view-models/grocery-list-view-model.js</code>, which contains code that looks a lot like what you already have in <code>list.js</code>:

<code>javascript
var config = require(&quot;../../shared/config&quot;);
var fetchModule = require(&quot;fetch&quot;);
var ObservableArray = require(&quot;data/observable-array&quot;).ObservableArray;

function GroceryListViewModel(items)  &#123;
    var viewModel = new ObservableArray(items);
    return viewModel;
 &#125;

module.exports = GroceryListViewModel;</code>

Let&#39;s expand on this to tie this view model to a backend.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Populate a list view from a backend</h4>

You&#39;re going to start by changing <code>list.js</code> to use the <code>GroceryListViewModel</code>. First, <code>require()</code> the <code>GroceryListViewModel</code> so you can use it:

<code>javascript
var GroceryListViewModel = require(&quot;../../shared/view-models/grocery-list-view-model&quot;);</code>

Next, <strong>remove</strong> the existing <code>var pageData</code> assignment:

<div class="no-copy-button"></div>

<pre><code class="lang-javascript">// Remove these seven lines of code
var pageData = new Observable( &#123;
    groceryList: new ObservableArray([
         &#123; name: &quot;eggs&quot;  &#125;,
         &#123; name: &quot;bread&quot;  &#125;,
         &#123; name: &quot;cereal&quot;  &#125;
    ])
 &#125;);
</code></pre>
<p>And add the code below in the same location:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var groceryList = new GroceryListViewModel([]);
var pageData = new Observable( &#123;
    groceryList: groceryList
 &#125;);
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, replace the existing <code>exports.loaded()</code> function with the one below, which calls two new methods on the view model—<code>empty()</code> and <code>load()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">exports.loaded = function(args)  &#123;
    page = args.object;
    page.bindingContext = pageData;

    groceryList.empty();
    groceryList.load();
 &#125;;
</code></pre>
<p>In this code, <code>groceryList</code> is referencing the grocery list model, and the <code>empty()</code> function empties the list, and then calls the view model&#39;s <code>load()</code> function to reload the data from the backend.</p>
<p>The last piece to make this work is actually implementing the <code>empty()</code> and <code>load()</code> functions in the view model. Open <code>app/shared/view-models/grocery-list-view-model.js</code>, and paste the following code between the <code>var viewModel</code> assignment, and the <code>return viewModel</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">viewModel.load = function()  &#123;
    return fetch(config.apiUrl + &quot;Groceries&quot;,  &#123;
        headers:  &#123;
            &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer &quot; + config.token
         &#125;
     &#125;)
    .then(handleErrors)
    .then(function(response)  &#123;
        return response.json();
     &#125;).then(function(data)  &#123;
        data.Result.forEach(function(grocery)  &#123;
            viewModel.push( &#123;
                name: grocery.Name,
                id: grocery.Id
             &#125;);
         &#125;);
     &#125;);
 &#125;;

viewModel.empty = function()  &#123;
    while (viewModel.length)  &#123;
        viewModel.pop();
     &#125;
 &#125;;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="explain">

The code to make an HTTP call should look familiar, as it leverages the same fetch module you used in the previous section. Here, the fetch module&#39;s first <code>then()</code> handler checks for HTTP errors, the second <code>then()</code> handler converts the data from the response into JSON format, and the third handler pushes each grocery item from the response into the ObservableArray.

If you load the app and log in with email address &quot;user@nativescript.org&quot; and password &quot;password&quot;, you should see a list of groceries that looks something like this:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/ios/3.png" alt="list 2">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/android/3.png" alt="list 2">

The cool thing here is the code you didn&#39;t have to write. Notice that there is no need to refresh the UI, or manually access the ListView UI component—all the view model does is push the JSON response to the ObservableArray, and the UI takes care of itself.

Let&#39;s see how you can build on top of this and enable users to add to their grocery list directly from the app.

## 4.5: GridLayout

You already know how to add items to a <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code>, because you just did so in the previous section—all you need to do is call the ObservableArray module&#39;s <code>push()</code> method.

To give the user the ability to manage their grocery list you&#39;re going to have to put some more UI components on the screen, and to do that you&#39;re going to need to divide the screen into rows and columns using the <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> UI component.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Implement the ability to add groceries to the list</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.xml</code> and change the <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> tag to use the code below:

<code>xml
&lt;GridLayout rows=&quot;auto, *&quot; columns=&quot;2*, *&quot;&gt;</code>

The <code>rows</code> attribute divides the screen into two rows, the first auto-sized according to its childrens&#39; height, and the other to contain *, or the remaining height of the screen. The <code>columns</code> attribute divides the screen into two columns, where the first column takes up 2/3 of the screen, and the second takes up the remaining third.

Next, to give the user a means of adding groceries to the list, add a text field and a button to the page. Add these two lines of code directly after the initial <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> tag:

<code>xml
&lt;TextField id=&quot;grocery&quot; text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; grocery  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot; hint=&quot;Enter a grocery item&quot; row=&quot;0&quot; col=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
&lt;Button text=&quot;Add&quot; tap=&quot;add&quot; row=&quot;0&quot; col=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</code>

The text field has an id attribute of <code>&quot;grocery&quot;</code>, and is bound to the <code> &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; grocery  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;</code> property of the page&#39;s binding context. The button&#39;s <code>tap</code> event refers to an <code>add()</code> function, that you&#39;ll add to the code-behind file momentarily.

But the most important thing to note here is the use of the <code>row</code> and <code>col</code> attributes. These attributes are zero-based, so the text field&#39;s <code>row=&quot;0&quot; col=&quot;0&quot;</code> attributes place it in the first row and first column, whereas the button&#39;s <code>row=&quot;0&quot; col=&quot;1&quot;</code> attributes place it in the first row and second column.

Finally, replace the <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code> tag with the code below to place it in the second row, to have it span both columns, and also to give it an <code>id</code> attribute that you&#39;ll need later.

<code>xml
&lt;ListView items=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; groceryList  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot; id=&quot;groceryList&quot; row=&quot;1&quot; colSpan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;</code>

Now you just need to make the necessary changes to the code-behind file to support these XML changes. Open <code>list.js</code> and start by adding a new <code>&quot;grocery&quot;</code> property to the <code>pageData</code> Observable. The <code>pageData</code> assignment should look like this:

<code>javascript
var pageData = new Observable( &#123;
    groceryList: groceryList,
    grocery: &quot;&quot;
 &#125;);</code>

Next, you need to add an <code>add()</code> function to handle the button tap event. Paste in the following code at the bottom of <code>list.js</code>:

<code>javascript
exports.add = function()  &#123;
    // Check for empty submissions
    if (pageData.get(&quot;grocery&quot;).trim() === &quot;&quot;)  &#123;
        dialogsModule.alert( &#123;
            message: &quot;Enter a grocery item&quot;,
            okButtonText: &quot;OK&quot;
         &#125;);
        return;
     &#125;

    // Dismiss the keyboard
    page.getViewById(&quot;grocery&quot;).dismissSoftInput();
    groceryList.add(pageData.get(&quot;grocery&quot;))
        .catch(function()  &#123;
            dialogsModule.alert( &#123;
                message: &quot;An error occurred while adding an item to your list.&quot;,
                okButtonText: &quot;OK&quot;
             &#125;);
         &#125;);

    // Empty the input field
    pageData.set(&quot;grocery&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
 &#125;;</code>

In this function, you first ensure the user didn&#39;t submit without typing a grocery. If the user did type something, you dismiss the device&#39;s keyboard, then you get the <code>&quot;grocery&quot;</code> property from the page&#39;s binding context (which is bound to the new <code>&lt;TextField&gt;</code>), and pass that value to the view model&#39;s <code>add()</code> function.

Finally, define that <code>add()</code> function. To do so, open <code>app/shared/view-models/grocery-list-view-model.js</code> and paste the following function under the <code>empty()</code> function, but before the <code>return viewModel</code> statement.

<code>javascript
viewModel.add = function(grocery)  &#123;
    return fetch(config.apiUrl + &quot;Groceries&quot;,  &#123;
        method: &quot;POST&quot;,
        body: JSON.stringify( &#123;
            Name: grocery
         &#125;),
        headers:  &#123;
            &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer &quot; + config.token,
            &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;
         &#125;
     &#125;)
    .then(handleErrors)
    .then(function(response)  &#123;
        return response.json();
     &#125;)
    .then(function(data)  &#123;
        viewModel.push( &#123; name: grocery, id: data.Result.Id  &#125;);
     &#125;);
 &#125;;</code>
</div>

<div class="explain">

If you build and rerun your app, you&#39;ll find that you can add a grocery item and it will appear immediately in your list—and, all of this is completely driven by a backend service. Pretty cool, huh?

Let&#39;s look at how you can polish this page with a NativeScript module for showing activity indicators.

## 4.6: ActivityIndicator

Currently there&#39;s a bit of a delay when you first visit the list page before groceries appear. This delay could confuse a new user, who might think the app is stuck rather than retrieving data from a backend.

In NativeScript apps you can use the ActivityIndicator module to show a spinner icon in your UI while your app is busy performing actions. The ActivityIndicator is a relatively simple UI element as it primarily uses one attribute—<code>busy</code>. When an ActivityIndicator&#39;s <code>busy</code> attribute is set to <code>true</code> the ActivityIndicator shows, and when its <code>busy</code> attribute is set to <code>false</code> it doesn&#39;t. Let&#39;s see how the module works by adding an ActivityIndicator to the list page.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add an ActivityIndicator</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.xml</code> and add the following element directly before the closing <code>&lt;/GridLayout&gt;</code> tag.

<code>xml
&lt;ActivityIndicator busy=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; isLoading  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot; rowSpan=&quot;2&quot; colSpan=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;</code>

Then, in <code>app/views/list/list.js</code>, replace the existing <code>groceryList.load()</code> call in <code>loaded()</code> with the following four lines of code:

<code>javascript
pageData.set(&quot;isLoading&quot;, true);
groceryList.load().then(function()  &#123;
    pageData.set(&quot;isLoading&quot;, false);
 &#125;);</code>

In the code above you add a new <code>&quot;isLoading&quot;</code> flag to the list page&#39;s Observable, and then bind the ActivityIndicator&#39;s <code>busy</code> attribute to that value. You set the initial value of the <code>&quot;isLoading&quot;</code> flag to <code>true</code> in the list page&#39;s <code>loaded()</code> function, which shows the ActivityIndicator. When the grocery list finishes loading, you flip the <code>&quot;isLoading&quot;</code> flag back to <code>false</code>, which hides the ActivityIndicator.

You control where the ActivityIndicator displays by setting its <code>rowSpan</code> and <code>colSpan</code> attributes. In this case <code>rowSpan=&quot;2&quot; colSpan=&quot;2&quot;</code> makes the ActivityIndicator take up both rows and both columns of its parent GridLayout. Here&#39;s what the new ActivityIndicator looks like:

The list page is now more user friendly, but we can improve the experience with one of the more powerful NativeScript modules: the animation module.

## 4.7: Animations

The ability to run robust and performant animations is the one of the biggest reasons people choose to build native mobile apps, and NativeScript makes running these animations simple. The NativeScript animation modules provides a <a href="/ui/animation">series of JavaScript APIs</a> that let you perform a wide variety of animations to elements on the screen, including the following:

- <a href="/ui/animation#opacity">Opacity</a>
- <a href="/ui/animation#background-color">Background Color</a>
- <a href="/ui/animation#translate">Translations</a>
- <a href="/ui/animation#scale">Scaling</a>
- <a href="/ui/animation#rotate">Rotating</a>

For our list page you’re going to use an <a href="/ui/animation#opacity">opacity animation</a> to fade in your grocery list after your data loads. Let’s add in the code and then discuss how it all works.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Add an animation</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.css</code> and add an <code>opacity: 0</code> rule to the existing <code>ListView</code> selector. The full set of rules should look like this:

<code>css
ListView  &#123;
    margin: 5;
    opacity: 0;
 &#125;</code>

Then, in <code>app/views/list/list.js</code>, replace the existing <code>exports.loaded()</code> function with the code below, which does two new things: gets a reference to the <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code> (<code>page.getViewById(&quot;groceryList&quot;)</code>), and then calls that element’s <code>animate()</code> function after the <code>groceryList.load()</code> call completes.

<code>javascript
exports.loaded = function(args)  &#123;
    page = args.object;
    var listView = page.getViewById(&quot;groceryList&quot;);
    page.bindingContext = pageData;

    groceryList.empty();
    pageData.set(&quot;isLoading&quot;, true);
    groceryList.load().then(function()  &#123;
        pageData.set(&quot;isLoading&quot;, false);
        listView.animate( &#123;
            opacity: 1,
            duration: 1000
         &#125;);
     &#125;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

A few things are happening in the code above.

First, in CSS, you assign an <code>opacity</code> of <code>0</code> to the grocery list <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code>. This hides the grocery list completely when the page loads. Next, in JavaScript, after the <code>groceryList.load()</code> call completes, you call the list view’s <code>animate()</code> function. This changes the element&#39;s <code>opacity</code> from <code>0</code> (completely hidden) to <code>1</code> (completely visible) over one full second.

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: The animation function’s <code>duration</code> property takes a time in milliseconds. Therefore, <code>1000</code> equates to one second.

The result of this code is a nice fade-in animation:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/ios/6.gif" alt="Animations on iOS">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter4/android/6.gif" alt="Animations on Android">

The animation module is a lot of fun to play with, and it’s easy to use too. All you need to do is get a reference to an element using <code>getViewById()</code>, and then call that element’s <code>animate</code> method. You may want to take a few minutes to look through our <a href="/ui/animation#examples">animation samples</a> and try a few of these animations for yourself in Groceries.

Now that you have the login, registration, and list pages complete, let’s enhance the app&#39;s functionality as a grocery list management tool. In the next chapters you&#39;ll add functionality such as email validation, social sharing, and more. And you&#39;ll use one of NativeScript&#39;s most useful features to do so: npm modules.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: There are several modules that come out of the box with your NativeScript installation that we did not have time to cover in this guide—including a <a href="">location service</a>, a <a href="">file-system helper</a>, a <a href="">timer module</a>, a <a href="">camera module</a>, a <a href="">color module</a>, and a whole lot more. Make sure to peruse the “Modules API” of the docs, or just look around <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules</code> to see all of what&#39;s available.

</div></div><div *ngIf="chapter == 5"><h1 id="chapter-5-plugins-and-npm-modules">Chapter 5—Plugins and npm Modules</h1>
<p>As you build more complex apps, you&#39;ll likely run into functionality that is not implemented in the NativeScript modules. But no worries, as NativeScript lets you leverage <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> (node package manager) to import npm modules into your apps. Alternately, you can install NativeScript plugins, which are simply npm modules that can access native code and use Android and iOS SDKs, if required. </p>
<p>In this chapter, you&#39;ll install and use an external email validator module to verify the format of email addresses as they are entered on the registration screen. Then, you&#39;ll add a NativeScript plugin, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-social-share">NativeScript social share</a>, to let users share their grocery lists using their device&#39;s native sharing widget.</p>

## 5.1: Using npm modules

It would be nice to be able to make sure people are entering well-formatted email addresses into your app on the registration screen. You could write this functionality yourself, but validating email addresses is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/validate-email-address-in-javascript">surprisingly tricky</a>, and it&#39;s a lot easier to use one of many npm modules that already provide this validation. For Groceries let&#39;s see how to add this <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator">email-validator module</a> to test for valid addresses.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4><b>Exercise</b>: Install the email validator module</h4>

Return to your terminal and make sure that you are working in the root directory in your Groceries project folder, a.k.a. here:

<div class="no-copy-button"></div>

<pre><code>sample-Groceries &lt;----------------
    ├── app
    │   └── ...
    ├── package.json
    └── platforms
        ├── android
        └── ios
</code></pre><p>From the root directory install the email-validator module:</p>
<pre><code>npm install email-validator --save
</code></pre></div>
<div class="explain">

The install process does a few things in the background. First, because you added the <code>--save</code> flag, npm records this dependency in your app&#39;s <code>package.json</code>. If you open your <code>package.json</code> you should see <code>&quot;email-validator&quot;</code> in your app&#39;s <code>&quot;dependencies&quot;</code> array.

<code>javascript
&quot;dependencies&quot;:  &#123;
  &quot;email-validator&quot;: &quot;^1.0.4&quot;
 &#125;</code>

The npm CLI also creates a <code>node_modules</code> folder in the root of your app. This folder contains the code for the email-validator module, which is a bit of validation logic in <code>node_modules/email_validator/index.js</code>. 

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: By saving your app&#39;s npm dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can always regenerate your <code>node_modules</code> folder by running <code>npm install</code>. Because of this, it&#39;s a common practice to exclude the <code>node_modules</code> folder from source control. The Groceries app uses git for source control, and as such includes <code>node_modules/</code> in its <code>.gitignore</code>.

Now that you have the module installed let&#39;s look at how to use it.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Use the email validator module
</h4>

Open <code>/app/shared/view-models/user-view-model.js</code> and add the following line at the top of the file:

<code>javascript
var validator = require(&quot;email-validator&quot;);</code>

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: The NativeScript framework&#39;s <code>require()</code> method is configured to look at the <code>&quot;main&quot;</code> value in an npm module&#39;s <code>package.json</code> file. In the case of this module, the <code>&quot;main&quot;</code> value is <code>&quot;index.js&quot;</code>. Therefore, when you run <code>require(&quot;email-validator&quot;)</code>, you&#39;re actually requiring the file at <code>node_modules/email_validator/index.js</code>. You could also type <code>require(&quot;email-validator/index&quot;)</code> to retrieve the same file.

To make use of this validator, add a function to <code>user-view-model.js</code>, right above the line <code>return viewModel</code>:

<code>javascript
viewModel.isValidEmail = function()  &#123;
    var email = this.get(&quot;email&quot;);
    return validator.validate(email);
 &#125;;</code>

Then, edit the registration function in <code>app/views/register/register.js</code> to trap any malformed email addresses:

<code>javascript
exports.register = function()  &#123;
    if (user.isValidEmail())  &#123;
        completeRegistration();
     &#125; else  &#123;
        dialogsModule.alert( &#123;
            message: &quot;Enter a valid email address.&quot;,
            okButtonText: &quot;OK&quot;
         &#125;);
     &#125;
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

In this function, the user submits an email and password, and the value is sent to the view model for validation. If it passes, registration can proceed, otherwise you show an alert. However in order to test out this change you’ll need to do one more thing.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Rebuild your app
</h4>

As we mentioned in chapter 1, although the <code>tns livesync</code> command is smart enough to reload your app for most changes you make to your app, certain changes require a full build—most notably, changes to native files in <code>app/App_Resources</code>, new modules installed with <code>npm install</code>, and new NativeScript plugins.

For NativeScript to recognize this new email-validator npm module, type <code>Ctrl+C</code> in your terminal to kill the existing <code>tns livesync</code> watcher if it’s still running, and then use <code>tns run</code> to rebuild your application and deploy it to an emulator or device.

<code>tns run ios --emulator</code>

Or

<code>tns run android --emulator</code>

After the app deploys you can again run the <code>livesync</code> command to setup the watcher again.

<code>tns livesync ios --emulator --watch</code>

Or

<code>tns livesync android --emulator --watch</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

After your app launches again, if you attempt to register with an invalid email address, you should see an alert that prevents the submission:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter5/ios/1.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter5/android/1.png" alt="">

In general npm modules greatly expand the number of things you&#39;re able to do in your NativeScript apps. Need date and time formatting? Use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment">moment</a>. Need utility functions for objects and arrays? Use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash">lodash</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/underscore">underscore</a>. This code reuse benefit gets even more powerful when you bring NativeScript plugins into the picture.

&gt; <strong>WARNING</strong>: Not all npm modules work in NativeScript apps. Specifically, modules that depend on Node.js or browser APIs will not work, as those APIs do not exist in NativeScript. The NativeScript wiki contains a <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/wiki/supported-npm-modules">list of some of the more popular npm modules that have been verified to work in NativeScript apps</a>.

## 5.2: Using NativeScript plugins

NativeScript plugins are npm modules that have the added ability to run native code and use iOS and Android frameworks. Because NativeScript plugins are just npm modules, a lot of the techniques you learned in the previous section still apply. The one big difference is in the command you use to install plugins. Let&#39;s look at how it works by installing the NativeScript social share plugin.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Install the social sharing plugin
</h4>

Return to your terminal, make sure you&#39;re still in the root of your app, and run the following command:

<code>bash
tns plugin add nativescript-social-share</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

The install process does the same thing that the <code>npm install</code> command does—including retrieving the module from npm, installing the module in <code>node_modules</code>, and saving the module as a dependency in your app&#39;s <code>package.json</code>—but the <code>tns plugin add</code> command additionally configures any native code that the plugin needs to use.

For example the <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/push-plugin">NativeScript push plugin</a> uses both iOS and Android SDKs, and the <code>tns plugin add</code> command takes care of installing those. The <a href="https://github.com/tjvantoll/nativescript-flashlight">NativeScript flashlight plugin</a> needs permissions to use the camera on Android, and the <code>tns plugin add</code> command takes care of setting that up too.

Now that you&#39;ve installed the social share plugin, let&#39;s look at how to use it.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Use the social sharing plugin
</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.js</code> and add the following line at the top of the file, which requires the social share module you just installed:

<code>javascript
var socialShare = require(&quot;nativescript-social-share&quot;);</code>

Next you have to build some UI that lets you share a grocery list. To do so, open <code>app/views/list/list.xml</code> and add the following code below the opening <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> tag, and above the opening <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> tag.

<code>xml
&lt;Page.actionBar&gt;
    &lt;ActionBar title=&quot;Groceries&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ActionBar.actionItems&gt;
            &lt;ActionItem text=&quot;Share&quot; tap=&quot;share&quot; ios.position=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/ActionBar.actionItems&gt;
    &lt;/ActionBar&gt;
&lt;/Page.actionBar&gt;</code>

This code defines an <a href="/ui/action-bar">ActionBar</a>, which is a UI component that includes various menu items, enclosed in the <code>&lt;ActionBar.actionItems&gt;</code> tag. The <code>title</code> of the ActionBar lets you show page-specific titles.

&gt; <strong>NOTE</strong>: On iOS devices, <code>&lt;ActionItem&gt;</code>s are placed from left to right in sequence; you can override that (as the code above does) by providing an <code>ios.position</code> attribute.

With the module installed and required, and the UI in place, you can implement the <code>&lt;ActionItem&gt;</code>&#39;s tap handler (<code>share()</code>) in the list page&#39;s code-behind file.

To do so, return to <code>list.js</code> and paste the following code at the bottom of the file:

<code>javascript
exports.share = function()  &#123;
    var list = [];
    var finalList = &quot;&quot;;
    for (var i = 0, size = groceryList.length; i &lt; size ; i++)  &#123;
        list.push(groceryList.getItem(i).name);
     &#125;
    var listString = list.join(&quot;, &quot;).trim();
    socialShare.shareText(listString);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

This code takes the groceries from the grocery list view model, converts the data into a comma-separated string, and passes that string to the social share module&#39;s <code>shareText()</code> method.

&gt; <strong>WARNING</strong>: Because this section had you install a NativeScript plugin, you’ll have to rebuild your app one last time in order to test your changes. If you don’t remember how refer back to <a href="chapter-5">chapter 5</a> for instructions.

Now when you run the app, you&#39;ll see a new button at the top of the screen. When you tap it, the native iOS or Android sharing widget will show to let you post your groceries to your social networks, or send them via email, message, or any other method you prefer.

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter5/ios/2.gif" alt="Social sharing widget on iOS">
<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter5/android/2.gif" alt="Social sharing widget on Android">

Pretty cool, huh? The ability to use npm modules greatly expands the number of things you&#39;re able to do in a NativeScript app. Need to compose emails in your app? Try out the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-email">NativeScript email plugin</a>. Need to use the clipboard in your app? Try out the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-clipboard">NativeScript clipboard plugin</a>.

If you&#39;re looking for NativeScript plugins start by searching both the <a href="http://plugins.telerik.com/nativescript">Telerik NativeScript Plugins Marketplace</a> and our <a href="http://plugins.nativescript.rocks">community-curated list of plugins on npm</a>. If you don&#39;t find the plugin you need, you can <a href="https://nativescript.ideas.aha.io/">request the plugin on our ideas portal</a>, or you can take a stab at <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins">creating the plugin yourself</a>.

Between NativeScript modules, npm modules, and NativeScript plugins, the NativeScript framework provides a lot of functionality you can use to build your next app. However, we&#39;ve yet to talk about NativeScript&#39;s most powerful feature: the ability to directly access iOS and Android APIs in JavaScript. Let&#39;s look at how it works.

</div>
</div><div *ngIf="chapter == 6"><h1 id="chapter-6-accessing-native-apis">Chapter 6—Accessing Native APIs</h1>
<p>The beauty of NativeScript is that you can write a native iOS or Android app in JavaScript, XML, and CSS without touching Swift, Objective-C, or Java, if you choose. But what if you want to present a different, more platform-specific UI to your users? Or if you want to access an iOS or Android API that NativeScript doesn&#39;t expose through a NativeScript module or plugin?</p>
<p>NativeScript gives you the option to dig into native code as needed, and to do so without leaving JavaScript. To show how this works in action, let&#39;s start by adding some color to the ActionBar in the iOS version of the Groceries app.</p>

## 6.1: Customize the ActionBar - iOS

When you use the ActionBar UI component, NativeScript is actually creating and managing an iOS <code>UINavigationController</code> for you. You can see this for yourself by digging into the implementation code, specifically <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules/ui/action-bar/action-bar.ios.js</code>, and <code>node_modules/tns-core-modules/ui/frame/frame.ios.js</code>.

What you might not realize is that the code that you see in these NativeScript modules, the code that looks like Objective-C-ified or Java-ified JavaScript code, is available for you to use in your own JavaScript modules. For example, you can easily get a reference to the <code>UINavigationBar</code> and simply call its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationBar_Class/index.html">documented methods</a> to change its look and feel. Let&#39;s look at how to do that.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Modify the ActionBar
</h4>

Before you start tinkering with the <code>UINavigationBar</code> let&#39;s add an <code>&lt;ActionBar&gt;</code> to the login and register pages, so that the app&#39;s three pages all have a consistent look.

Open <code>app/views/register/register.xml</code> and paste the following code in directly after the opening <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> tag:

<code>xml
&lt;Page.actionBar&gt;
    &lt;ActionBar title=&quot;Sign up&quot;&gt;&lt;/ActionBar&gt;
&lt;/Page.actionBar&gt;</code>

Next, open <code>app/views/login/login.xml</code> and paste in the following code, again directly after the opening <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> tag:

<code>xml
&lt;Page.actionBar&gt;
    &lt;ActionBar title=&quot;Sign in&quot;&gt;&lt;/ActionBar&gt;
&lt;/Page.actionBar&gt;</code>

Finally, open <code>app/app.css</code> and paste the following CSS to modify the ActionBar’s colors:

<code>css
ActionBar  &#123;
    color: white;
    background-color: #2E6DAD;
 &#125;</code>

With the ActionBar in place, let&#39;s look at how to customize its look with some native iOS APIs. Open <code>app/views/login/login.js</code> and paste the following code in the <code>exports.loaded()</code> function, directly after the <code>var page = args.object;</code> assignment:

<code>javascript
if (page.ios)  &#123;
    var navigationBar = frameModule.topmost().ios.controller.navigationBar;
    navigationBar.barStyle = UIBarStyle.UIBarStyleBlack;
 &#125;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

Ok, let&#39;s break down what just happened, starting with the <code>if (page.ios)</code> check. NativeScript modules, in general, follow the pattern of exposing their native implementations through <code>ios</code> and <code>android</code> properties. You can see this in the if check (<code>page.ios</code>), and also on the first line within the if check, as <code>frameModule.topMost().ios</code> is used to retrieve a reference to the underlying <code>UINavigationController</code>. Testing for the existence of these properties (e.g. <code>if (page.ios)</code>) is a convenient way to fork your code, to ensure that iOS-specific code only runs on iOS, and Android-specific code only runs on Android.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: As a best practice, testing for a platform with an if check is the way to go when you have a small number of platform-specific changes to make. If, on the contrary, you have big, entirely different chunks of code for iOS and Android, you might want to go with <a href="#platform-specific-files">platform-specific code-behind files</a>—e.g. <code>login.ios.js</code> and <code>login.android.js</code>.

Within the if block, you start by getting a reference to the <code>UINavigationBar</code>, and then you set its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKitDataTypesReference/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/UIBarStyle"><code>barStyle</code> property</a> to <code>UIBarStyle.UIBarStyleBlack</code>, which (counter intuitively) makes the iOS status bar use white text. This produces the look shown below:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter6/ios/1.png" alt="The iOS actionbar with updated colors">

Learning how to transfer iOS and Android APIs into valid NativeScript code can take a little trial and error to get right. You can always refer to the NativeScript docs for detailed discussions of how to handle the code conversion. Here are the <a href="/runtimes/android/marshalling/java-to-js.html">docs for Android</a>, and here are the <a href="/runtimes/ios/marshalling/Marshalling-Overview.html">docs for iOS</a>.

&gt; <strong>TIP</strong>: NativeScript provides TypeScript declaration files for all iOS and Android APIs. If you&#39;re using TypeScript you can reference these declaration files to enable code completion in your editor. Even if you&#39;re not using TypeScript, these declaration files can be invaluable references when you&#39;re transferring native APIs to NativeScript code. For instance try searching for “UINavigationBar” in the iOS declaration file below to see which other properties are available.
&gt; - <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/master/tns-core-modules/ios.d.ts">iOS TypeScript declaration file</a>
&gt; - <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/master/tns-core-modules/android17.d.ts">Android TypeScript declaration file</a>

Forking the user experience can entail more than just changing some colors. For example, sliding to delete list items is a common UI interaction on iOS, but not Android. But as you&#39;ve seen, NativeScript makes it relatively easy to fork your code to provide a more platform-specific experience. So to allow a user to delete an item from a list, let&#39;s create a slide-to-delete UI for iOS, and use a more-Android-friendly trash can icon to let the user delete items from our Android app.

## 6.2: Deleting from a list - Android

For Android you&#39;re going to add tappable trash cans to each item in the grocery list; so the first challenge is figuring out how to show these images only for Android, as you&#39;ll be using a completely different UI on iOS.

To do so you&#39;ll use a new bit of syntax in your XML. NativeScript allows you to set an attribute for only one platform using the <code>platform:attributeName</code> syntax. For example the following sets a button&#39;s text to “foo” on iOS, and “bar” on Android:

<code>xml
&lt;Button ios:text=&quot;foo&quot; android:text=&quot;bar&quot; /&gt;</code>

This same syntax is available for all attributes for all UI components, and this mechanism is another convenient way NativeScript lets you fork your code for separate iOS and Android implementations. Let&#39;s use this technique to show a trash can only on Android.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add an Android-only UI element
</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.xml</code>, find the <code>&lt;ListView.itemTemplate&gt;</code> tag, and replace it with the code below:

<code>xml
&lt;ListView.itemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;GridLayout columns=&quot;*, auto&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Label text=&quot; &#123;% raw % &#125; &#123; &#123; name  &#125; &#125; &#123;% endraw % &#125;&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;Image src=&quot;res://ic_menu_delete&quot; ios:visibility=&quot;collapsed&quot; col=&quot;1&quot; tap=&quot;delete&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/GridLayout&gt;
&lt;/ListView.itemTemplate&gt;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

With this code you&#39;re primarily adding an <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> to the existing ListView template. But now that you have multiple UI components in this template, you have to tell NativeScript how to layout these two components, which is what the <code>&lt;GridLayout&gt;</code> handles. By specifying <code>columns=&quot;*, auto&quot;</code> you divide each item into two columns: the first containing the label and the second containing the new image.

For the image itself, the <code>ios:visibility=&quot;collapsed&quot;</code> attribute sets the image&#39;s <code>visibility</code> CSS property to <code>&quot;collapsed&quot;</code>, which hides it. Because the attribute was prefixed with <code>ios:</code>, that CSS property is only applied on iOS; therefore the button displays on Android devices, but not on iOS ones. The trash can image itself has already been placed in the app for you, and can be found in appropriate sizes in the four drawable folders in <code>/app/App_Resources/Android</code>. Here&#39;s what the trash can UI looks like on Android:

<img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter6/android/1.png" alt="Trash can icons on Android">

Finally, make the trash actually delete items. To do that you&#39;ll need to implement the <code>tap=&quot;delete&quot;</code> handler in the list code-behind file.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Build the delete functions
</h4>

Open <code>app/views/list/list.js</code> and paste the following code at the bottom of the file:

<code>javascript
exports.delete = function(args)  &#123;
    var item = args.view.bindingContext;
    var index = groceryList.indexOf(item);
    groceryList.delete(index);
 &#125;;</code>

This code gets the index of the grocery the user tapped, matches that to the corresponding item in the view model, and then passes that index to the view model&#39;s <code>delete()</code> method—which doesn&#39;t exist yet, so let&#39;s create it.

Open <code>app/shared/view-models/grocery-list-view-model.js</code> and paste in the code below. Remember to add this function toward the end of the file, right above the <code>return viewModel</code> line:

<code>javascript
viewModel.delete = function(index)  &#123;
    return fetch(config.apiUrl + &quot;Groceries/&quot; + viewModel.getItem(index).id,  &#123;
        method: &quot;DELETE&quot;,
        headers:  &#123;
            &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer &quot; + config.token,
            &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;
         &#125;
     &#125;)
    .then(handleErrors)
    .then(function()  &#123;
        viewModel.splice(index, 1);
     &#125;);
 &#125;;</code>

</div>

<div class="explain">

This code probably looks fairly familiar by now. You&#39;re again calling the fetch module&#39;s <code>fetch()</code> method, this time specifying a <code>method</code> of <code>&quot;DELETE&quot;</code> to delete a grocery from the backend. You again return a <code>Promise</code> so the calling function can handle successful and unsuccessful calls. Note again the power of using the MVVM approach for building your app. To update the grocery list UI, all you have to do is remove the item from the ObservableArray (<code>viewModel.splice(index, 1)</code>), and let the list&#39;s presentation take care of itself.

If you run your app on Android you should be able to delete items from the list.

Now that you have built the interface for Android&#39;s tappable icon, let&#39;s add a swipe delete interface for iOS.

## 6.3: Deleting from a list - iOS

If you&#39;re an iOS user you&#39;re probably familiar with the slide-to-delete gesture as it&#39;s common in a number of iOS applications. The code to implement the gesture is actually baked into the iOS SDK itself (see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableViewCell_Class/#//apple_ref/c/tdef/UITableViewCellEditingStyle"><code>UITableViewCellEditingStyle</code>&#39;s docs</a>), so you can directly use those APIs in your NativeScript apps.

The code to do so is a little trickier than our previous example for Android, so we&#39;ve provided a ready-built module to implement this functionality in the <code>shared/utils/ios-swipe-delete.js</code> file. In this file you&#39;ll find a custom implementation of a data source that adheres to the <code>UITableViewDataSource</code> protocol. The file exports a single <code>enable()</code> function, which takes a reference to a ListView, and injects that ListView with the custom data source behavior.

Don&#39;t worry too much about exactly what this code is doing, as it involves a bit of understanding of how iOS APIs works. What is cool is that you <em>can</em> implement this relatively advanced iOS API in a few dozen lines of code, and that it&#39;s really easy to wrap this code with a very simple JavaScript API. This ease of use is exactly why NativeScript modules and NativeScript plugins are so easy to consume. Let&#39;s look at how to use this module.

</div>

<div class="exercise-start">

<h4>
    <b>Exercise</b>: Edit the ListView
</h4>

Add the following line of code to the top of <code>app/views/list/list.js</code>:

<code>javascript
var swipeDelete = require(&quot;../../shared/utils/ios-swipe-delete&quot;);</code>

Then, add the following code to the <code>exports.loaded()</code> function, directly under the <code>page = args.object;</code> assignment:

<code>javascript
if (page.ios)  &#123;
    var listView = page.getViewById(&quot;groceryList&quot;);
    swipeDelete.enable(listView, function(index)  &#123;
        groceryList.delete(index);
     &#125;);
 &#125;</code>

</div>

<p>This code gets a reference to the page&#39;s <code>&lt;ListView&gt;</code> id and then passes that reference to the swipe-to-delete module&#39;s <code>enable()</code> function. The <code>enable()</code> function also takes a callback, so you additionally pass an inline function that calls the view model&#39;s <code>delete()</code> function that you built in the previous section. Here&#39;s what the swipe-to-delete functionality looks like on iOS:</p>
<p><img src="/img/cli-getting-started/nativescript/chapter6/ios/2.gif" alt="deleting from a list on iOS"></p>
<p>And... that&#39;s it! You&#39;ve created a functional, cross-platform, backend-driven app to manage your grocery list. In the process you&#39;ve created a unique UI for Android and iOS, leveraged NativeScript plugins and npm modules, learned how to log in and register, managed backend services, created a list with add and delete functionality, and more. </p>

</ul>
<h2 id="7-2-start-your-own-app">7.2: Start your own app</h2>
<p>Although you’re welcome to use Groceries as the basis of your own app, if you want to start a new app from scratch, the NativeScript CLI provides a number of built-in starting points. For example, you can start a new “hello world” app by running the <code>tns create</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">tns create MyNextGreatApp
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to start from a slightly more complete starting point, the <code>tns create</code> command also has a <code>--template</code> option that lets you start from a variety of pre-built templates. For instance, the following command creates a NativeScript project with tab navigation already setup.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">tns create MyNextGreatApp --template tns-template-tab-navigation
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: A number of other templates are available to use with the <code>--template</code> option, including TypeScript templates and more. Refer to <a href="https://www.tjvantoll.com/2016/02/22/creating-nativescript-templates/">the full list of official templates</a> at any time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of which template you choose to start from, once you have your app up and running, let’s look at some of the resources you can use as you develop.</p>
